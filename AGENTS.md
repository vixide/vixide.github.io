## What this is

A SvelteKit project (`@sveltejs/adapter-static`) that prerenders the public
site for [Vix](https://github.com/vixide/vix), deployed by GitHub Actions to
<https://vixide.github.io/>. It does not implement or ship any part of the
editor — see [index.md](index.md) for scope.

## Working rules

- Uses [Lily Design System](https://lilydesignsystem.github.io/)'s headless
  Svelte components (`lily-design-system-svelte-headless`) for semantic
  HTML/ARIA structure — `Header`, `NavigationMenu`, `Card`, etc. They ship no
  CSS; every rule lives in [`static/assets/style.css`](static/assets/style.css)
  against Lily's class hooks (`.button`, `.card`, `.header`, `.navigation-menu`,
  …). Keep new UI on this pattern rather than hand-rolled markup where a
  matching headless component exists.
- Keep feature copy in sync with the `vix` repo's own `index.md` — this site
  paraphrases it, not the other way round; when `vix`'s feature list changes,
  update `src/routes/features/+page.svelte` and the home page's card grid to
  match.
- `npm run build` must prerender cleanly (`strict: true` in
  `svelte.config.js` fails the build on an unreachable route or broken link)
  before pushing to `main` — that's also what the deploy workflow runs.
- Run `npm run check` (svelte-check) before committing changes to `src/`.
